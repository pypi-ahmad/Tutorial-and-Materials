# In this example, we are using the iris dataset and implementing kernel SVM to classify the flowers into different species. We start by importing the necessary libraries and modules, and then load the dataset using the Pandas library.

# Next, we split the dataset into independent and dependent variables, and then split it into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.

# We then scale the features using the StandardScaler function to normalize the data.

# After that, we create an instance of the SVC (Support Vector Classification) class from Scikit-learn and set the kernel parameter to 'rbf' to specify the use of a Gaussian radial basis function kernel. We fit the model to the training set using the fit method of the SVC class.

# Finally, we make predictions on the test set using the predict method, and create a confusion matrix using the confusion_matrix function from Scikit-learn to evaluate the performance of the model.
