As mentioned earlier, the criterion of optimality is a theoretical framework used in reinforcement learning to determine the optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. There are different algorithms and approaches to solving this problem, such as value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning, and SARSA. Here is a sample Python code for the value iteration algorithm:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# define the transition probability matrix
# P[s,a,s'] is the probability of transitioning from state s to s'
# under action a
P = np.array([
    # action 0: up
    [[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]],
    # action 1: down
    [[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]],
    # action 2: left
    [[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]],
    # action 3: right
    [[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]]
])

# define the reward matrix
# R[s,a] is the reward obtained for taking action a in state s
R = np.array([
    [-0.04, -0.04, -0.04],
    [-0.04, None, -1.00],
    [-0.04, -0.04, +1.00]
])

# define the discount factor
gamma = 0.99

# initialize the value function
V = np.zeros(3)

# set the convergence threshold
eps = 0.0001

# perform value iteration
while True:
    delta = 0
    for s in range(3):
        v = V[s]
        V[s] = max([sum([P[s,a,s1]*(R[s,a] + gamma*V[s1]) for s1 in range(3)]) for a in range(4)])
        delta = max(delta, abs(v - V[s]))
    if delta < eps:
        break

# print the optimal value function and policy
print("Optimal value function:")
print(V)
print("Optimal policy:")
print([np.argmax([sum([P[s,a,s1]*(R[s,a] + gamma*V[s1]) for s1 in range(3)]) for a in range(4)]) for s in range(3)])

# In this code, we first define the transition probability matrix P and the reward matrix R for a simple 3x3 grid world with 4 possible actions (up, down, left, and right). We also set the discount factor gamma to 0.99, which determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.

# Then, we initialize the value function V to all zeros, and set a convergence threshold eps of 0.0001. We then perform the value iteration algorithm, which updates the value function V iteratively by computing the maximum expected reward for each state, given the current policy.

# Finally, we print the optimal value function and policy, which tells us the expected cumulative reward and the optimal action to take in each state.
